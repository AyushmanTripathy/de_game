# Logic Gates Simulation

every Box will have a gate associated with it

1. Make things that work
    - we will call for output gates
    - backtrack through all the connections and gates to provide outputs

1. Fix the infinite loop issue
    - cache the value for some time, before recomputing.
    - call the output gates in time interval

### TODO

[x] Gates structure
[x] Makes it work

[ ] IO system
[ ] Fix loops
